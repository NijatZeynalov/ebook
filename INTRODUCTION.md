**Introduction**
**Why This Guide?**
AI is evolving rapidly. As models become larger and more capable, there's a growing need for efficient ways to run them—faster, using less memory, and in production-ready environments. Today’s AI models, including large language models (LLMs), multimodal transformers, and image-text models, are used widely across language processing, computer vision, and generative applications.

However, real-world deployment isn’t just about building these models. Achieving high performance requires a solid understanding of GPU architecture, writing efficient code, choosing the right tools for inference, and managing systems with multiple GPUs or machines.

This guide is here to help you master those skills.

Whether you're an ML engineer focused on serving models, a researcher improving training speed, or a systems developer building AI infrastructure—this guide walks you through the essentials.

From CUDA basics to advanced compilation and deployment strategies, it takes you step by step through everything you need.

---

**Program Overview**
The guide is structured into three progressive phases:

**Phase 1: Foundations**
Explore the fundamentals—GPU architecture, CUDA, PyTorch profiling, quantization techniques, and model compression.

**Phase 2: Advanced Inference**
Learn how to deploy models in real time using vLLM, TGI, and Triton Server, and optimize performance with CUDA and Triton kernels.

**Phase 3: Distributed Systems**
Scale workloads across multiple GPUs and machines. Learn distributed inference, MLOps practices, and deployment strategies for edge and cloud platforms.
